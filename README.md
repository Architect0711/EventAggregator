# EventAggregator

This is my Implementation of the EventAggregator Pattern. 
I created this Project when I started to explore the loosely coupled Architecture of the WPF MVVM Pattern.
There are Synchronous and Asynchronous Implementations: Static and Nonstatic (for Dependency Injection, register as Singleton!).
